  "description": "In this project I have created an application which is easy to access and user friendly. For this application I used the backend as MongoDB to store the data which is used in the application and for the user interface we had used the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java Script and NodeJS. This portal is for selling and renting users commodities among fellow users.  This system is a full-stack web application used to post an ad for the items which they no longer require and wish keep it for sale or rent. Using this system, the user/customer can view other userâ€™s advertisement in order to deal with them conveniently. User can view details of the advertisements without going anywhere. The website is flexible to be used. It is convenient for users as this system provides accurate details and description of the products. Hence the system saves time, efforts and cost.",
